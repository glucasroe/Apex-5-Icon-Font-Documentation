# Apex 5 Icon Font Documentation

## What this is:
**READ THESE SCARY BOLD LETTERS: THIS IS NOT AN ORACLE SANCTIONED PROJECT. I HAVE NO AFFILIATION WITH ORACLE OR APEX.**
As I began working with APEX 5, I liked their icon font and wanted to suse it. Sadly, they seem to have no documentation for it at all. This is an attempt to construct some documentation for it.

##CSS Classes
Almost all icons are required to have `.a-icon` tagged on to the same element, i.e. `class="a-Icon icon-tree-folder"`


## On \E053
This glyph has 5 icons shoved into it that clip outside of the glyph definition. It breaks stuff everywhere and is generally terrible. I don't plan on editing it to make it usable.

## Thin Versions:
It seems like the icons all have thick and thin versions, but I can't figure out how they specify the thin versions of things. If you find anything, feel free to [tweet to me](https://twitter.com/glucasroe) or make a pull request.

## What you could do to help:
I hope to make an HTML version of this that's more usable than the Sketch file, so that would be pretty bomb. Maybe something similar to the [FontAwesome Cheatsheet](http://fontawesome.io/cheatsheet/).
